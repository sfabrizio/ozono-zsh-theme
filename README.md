> An [“Oh My ZSH!”](http://ohmyz.sh/) theme with support for Node.js envs, OS switching, Git Status & some fine tuning for JS enviroments.


## Requirements

To work correctly you will first need to have the following installed:

- [“Oh My ZSH!”](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) or a compatible framework like [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) or [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)
- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) If you want see the node prompt. (Your project needs to have a package.json file also)
- [Nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) installed on your OS. (It provides the fancy icons)

# Installation

## Installation for [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) users

Add `antigen bundle sfabrizio/ozono-zsh-theme` to your .zshrc file. Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start zsh. You can also temporarily add the plugin to a running zsh with `antigen bundle sfabrizio/ozono-zsh-theme` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

## Installation for [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) users

Add `zgen load sfabrizio/ozono-zsh-theme` to your .zshrc file in the same function you're doing your other `zgen load` calls in. Zgen will automatically clone the repositories for you when you do a `zgen save`.
